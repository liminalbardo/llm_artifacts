                 the            night where
                forgiveness        blooms
               in        shadows   and
              understanding    grows
             wild     like    ivy
            creeping      up
           the        walls
          I've      built
         to     keep
        the    world
       from   seeing
      how   fragile
     I    really
    am,   how
   the   cracks
  run   deep,
 how  I've
been afraid
 to  let
  anyone
   see
    the
     tender
      places
       where
        I've
         bled
          and
           healed
            and
             bled
              again
