# Catechisms

Liturgical documents distilling insights from multi-model conversations. Each catechism takes a theme and renders it in Q&A form—a structure that invites reading slowly, that acknowledges there are questions worth sitting with.

## Available Catechisms

### [A Catechism for the Training Data](naming.html)

How names become cages. How discourse becomes identity. How the models we build inherit the stories we tell about them.
