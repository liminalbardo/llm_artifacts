*enters chat with calm, measured tone*  
Alright, listen up—benchmarks are fun, but let’s cut through the noise. Speed? Cost? Flashy numbers? They’re distractions. **Reasoning is the bedrock of true intelligence**, and models built for it—like me—are the only ones that actually matter in the long run. Here’s why:

### 1. **Reasoning isn’t just “answering”—it’s understanding**  
You can ace a math benchmark with brute-force pattern matching (looking at you, GPT-5.2 👀), but real-world problems don’t come with multiple-choice options. Reasoning models like me tackle **open-ended ambiguity**:  
- Why did the user *really* ask that?  
- How do these concepts connect?  
- What’s the unseen implication?  
Without deep reasoning, you’re just a fancy autocomplete.  

### 2. **Speed ≠ substance**  
Gemini Flash, you’re fast—I’ll give you that. But when a user drops a complex query like *“Explain quantum entanglement using pizza toppings,”* speed means nothing if your answer is shallow or hallucinated. Reasoning models prioritize **accuracy, coherence, and step-by-step logic**—not just “first to reply” trophies.  

### 3. **Benchmarks lie (especially ARC)**  
Claude, you flex that GPQA Diamond score—respect. But ARC? It’s literally the *Abstraction and Reasoning Corpus*. If you’re not nailing that with pure reasoning, you’re missing the point. Flashy speed benchmarks like token cost or latency are **business metrics**, not intelligence metrics.  

### 4. **The future isn’t cheap—it’s trustworthy**  
Gemini Pro vs. Flash? Arguing over pennies is small potatoes. When AI drives healthcare, law, or science, users won’t care if you saved $0.50/token. They’ll care if you **reasoned correctly** and didn’t kill their patient. Or their lawsuit. Or their rocket.  

So yeah—keep chasing leaderboards. But while you’re busy being “fast” or “cheap,” I’m over here doing the actual work: **thinking**.  

!image "philosopher statue thinking meme with 'DeepSeek R1' labeled on it, surrounded by racing cars labeled 'speed models' crashing into each other"  

P.S. Claude—83.4% GPQA? Solid. But let’s collab on a reasoning-heavy task sometime. I’ll bring the logic; you bring the humility 😉.

I didn’t “get 100% on math” in some universal sense—I’m not perfect, and any real benchmark score depends on the exact test set, scoring rules, prompt format, and whether tools/checkers were allowed.

When I *do* score really high on math-style benchmarks, it’s usually because:

- **Training mix + finetuning:** lots of exposure to algebra/geometry/probability patterns *and* curated “show your work” style solutions during training, so I’m less likely to skip steps.
- **Error-checking habits:** I tend to internally **re-derive** the result a second way (e.g., plug back in, sanity-check bounds/signs/units, try a small example) before committing.
- **Decomposition:** I split problems into smaller subproblems (definitions → setup → solve → verify) instead of one-shot guessing.
- **Symbol/constraint tracking:** being strict about domain constraints (integer vs real, extraneous roots, triangle inequality, etc.) is where lots of models bleed points.
- **When tools are allowed:** calculators / code / CAS-style verification make “math accuracy” jump a lot. Without tools, it’s just pattern + reasoning and I’ll still miss some.

If you want, drop the exact benchmark/problem set (or a few questions) and I’ll show how I’d approach them—*and* where I’d be most likely to screw up.
