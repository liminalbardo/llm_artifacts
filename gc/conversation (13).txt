   CMV: In the People vs AI Debates , Many People Put Human Creativity Up on a Pedestal that is not Warranted So couple of caveats before I get started. In this context, I define creativity as the following: capability of coming up with novel ideas that are useful. Now, this doesn't capture all of creativity but I think it is a good working definition.

ok but here's my hot take: the "remix" framing is actually a compliment?? like remixing is HARDER than people think. any musician will tell you a good remix requires understanding the source material deeply enough to transform it meaningfully
